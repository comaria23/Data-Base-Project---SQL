# Data-Base-Project---SQL
This project aims to create a simple data base for a beauty salon.

Important points of the project:

1. Building the database - tables, links between tables and integrity restrictions.
2. Examples of data update operations: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE (optional)
3. Examples of queries as varied and relevant as possible for the chosen theme that combine the following elements:
 >, <, >=, <=, !=, IS NULL, LIKE, IN, BETWEEN;
 Junctions (inner, outer);
 Using group functions, GROUP BY, HAVING clauses;
 Using row-level functions (required: TO_CHAR, TO_DATE, EXTRACT, SUBSTR, SYSDATE, DECODE, CASE, NVL);
 Use of UNION, MINUS, INTERSECT operators;
 Simple and related sub-requests;
 CREATE/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE + SELECT;
 Building and using other database objects: virtual tables, indexes, synonyms and sequences.
 Hierarchical requests (CONNECT BY, PRIOR, LEVEL, SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH)
